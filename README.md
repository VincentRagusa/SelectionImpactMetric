# Selection Impact Metric
Code and Data related to the Selection Impact Metric. 
## Publication Figures
These .ipynb files contain the code used to generate the data for, and plot, the figures seen in the publication. They are annotated with comments and descriptions, however you can always contact me if you need assistance using the files.

## Misc. Files
These files contain all of the files I have pertaining to the research. They include prototype and intermediate forms of the published methods and figures, preleminary or experimental methods, and unpublished data. These files are not necessarily meant to be useful to anyone, but are here primarily in the case that myself or another wishes to extend the published work. I would appreciate a citation of some kind if any work is derrived from the contents of these files. If you have questions about these files, feel free to contact me.
